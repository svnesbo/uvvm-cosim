# Co-simulation library for UVVM

This library aims to make it easy to setup basic co-simulation for UVVM testbench, by enabling communication with your simulated DUT using VVCs instances in your testbench. Very few changes are required to integrate this with an existing testbench.

It uses VHPI to start a JSON-RPC server in a dedicated thread. From a JSON-RPC client, accessed from your application, you can:
- Get a list of available VVCs in the simulation
- Transmit and receive data to any supported VVC

The server maintains a set of queues, one for transmit and one for receive, for each VVC in the simulation. Transmit data sent from the client is put in a transmit queue by the server. And when the client makes a request for received data, the server responds with data that is available in the receive queue.
On the VHDL side, an entity called `uvvm_cosim` uses VHPI foreign function/procedure calls to access the same queues and basically forwards this to and from the VVCs using their transmit and receive procedures.

The VHPI code and JSON-RPC server is written in C++ and there is a basic C++ client as well. But there is also example client code for Python, and the protocol is very simple and should be easy to implement in a custom client.

## Simulator support

It has only been tested with NVC at the moment, but it may work with other simulators that support VHPI. Older commits of NVC than [3b81846](https://github.com/nickg/nvc/commit/3b81846) may not work.

For reference, this is likely because local variables are used for `libraryName` and `modelName` when registering foreign functions in `register_vhpi_foreign_method` in `uvvm_cosim_utils.hpp`.


## Integration in an existing testbench

Assuming you have a UVVM testbench with VVCs setup already, the basic steps to integrate this library is as follows.

1. Create an instance of `uvvm_cosim` in your test bench/harness:

```
inst_uvvm_cosim: entity work.uvvm_cosim
    generic map (
      GC_SIM_RUN_CTRL_EN => true)
    port map (
      clk => clk);
```

2. Add a test case or mode where your DUT is in a "free-running" mode.

It should be reset, initialized, have all the necessary clocks and be ready to use. Your testbench sequencer process should either run "forever" or with a very long timeout. You should not drive stimuli to the DUT using the VVC instances you plan to access with the cosim library (but it's fine to drive other necessary stimuli, for example some input data for your DUT to process if you don't want to do this via co-sim).

3. Make sure VVCs/BFMs are configured appropriately for co-sim

**UART VVC:**
Set infinite receive timeout (which is also the default):
```
shared_uart_vvc_config(RX, VVC_ID).bfm_config.timeout := 0 ns;
``` 

**AXISTREAM VVC:**
This VVC does not support infinite "timeout". But the co-sim library will automatically restart receive transactions as they timeout. So, just choose some value for `max_wait_cycles` that is appropriate for your DUT:
```
shared_axistream_vvc_config(VVC_ID).bfm_config.max_wait_cycles := 1000;
```

Since receive will likely timeout frequently (depending on how high you set max wait), you will have to set `max_wait_cycles_severity` to not trigger an error, which would cause UVVM to end the simulation. Your options are `NO_ALERT` or `NOTE`.
```
shared_axistream_vvc_config(VVC_ID).bfm_config.max_wait_cycles_severity := NO_ALERT;
```

At the moment, AXI-Stream packets (using TLAST), is not supported. So `check_packet_length` must be disabled:
```
shared_axistream_vvc_config(VVC_ID).bfm_config.check_packet_length := false;
```

4. Compile and run your simulation

Add the co-sim VHDL sources to your project. They reside under `src/vhdl`. And compile the C++ cosim library (see instructions below).

When the simulator is run you will have to load the shared library. The parameter for this is `--load=path/to/libuvvm_cosim_vhpi.so` if you are using NVC.


## Build instructions for C++ co-sim library

Clone this repo and initialize submodules:
```
git submodule update --init
```

This will initialize all three submodules used in this project:
- json-rpc-cxx
- hdlregression
- uvvm

Technically, only json-rpc-cxx is needed to build the C++ library, so you can save some time by only updating that submodule. But run the example in this repo you will need all of them.

To build the C++ library and C++ example client:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

If you want to run the testbench in this repo, you need to have initialized the hdlregression uvvm submodules, **and you will need nvc in your PATH**.

To start the simulation and JSON-RPC co-sim server:
```
make hdl_run
```

While the simulation is running and the server is listening, you can test the example client by running (also from the build directory):
```
./uvvm_cosim_example_client
```

There are also two example clients for Python under `src/python`. One using the `requests` library and another using `tinyrpc-lib`.


# JSON-RPC protocol

None of the JSON-RPC methods are "blocking" in the sense that they will immediately return a response and not wait for the actual request to be completed. For transmit calls, this means the data is queued up in the cosim-server, and gradually transmitted as the simulation progresses. For VVCs or VVC channels that can receive, and which have listening enabled, received data is stored in a queue in the cosim-server. Calls to the JSON-RPC receive methods will also return a response immediately, and this response will either include the requested amount of bytes if the queue has sufficient data, or, if the queue has less data available than requested, the method will return either what is available or none at all depending on what parameters it was called with.

## JSON-RPC request format

Standard JSON-RPC 2.0 where the `method` field specifies the remote procedure to call, and the `params` field contains parameters to the procedure. Some example request:

```
{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"GetVvcList","params":[]}
```

```
{"id":2,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"TransmitBytes","params":["UART_VVC",0,[7,8,9,10,11,12]]}
```

```
{"id":3,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"ReceiveBytes","params":["UART_VVC",1,12,false]}
```


## JSON-RPC response format

JSON response from a RPC call which doesn't return other data:

```
{
  "success": true/false,
  "result": {},
  "id": id
}
```

ID matches the request ID. The `result` field will be empty in responses from requests that don't return any data. It will also be empty for failed requests (in this case the `success` field is false).

> In principle, the `result` field could have been "null" or omitted for responses that don't have results or for failed requests. But "null" value fields were not used since they can be a bit tricky to deal with in different languages. Example here using null for a string value in nlohmann's JSON for Modern C++ (the library used by json-rpc-cxx): https://github.com/nlohmann/json/discussions/4003

For RPC calls that should return data the result field should contain a JSON object with the results (so, the structure of the `result` field depends on which remote procedure was called). Below is a typical example for a `receive_bytes` call:

```
{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    data: [10, 20, 30, 40]
  },
 "id": 1
}
```

Another example, for a call to get the list of VVCs in the simulation:

```
{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    [
	  {
	    "vvc_type": "CLOCK_GENERATOR_VVC"
	    "vvc_channel": "NA",
	    "vvc_instance_id": 0,
		"vvc_cfg": {"cosim_support": 0},
	  },
      {
	    "vvc_type": "UART_VVC",
	    "vvc_channel": "RX",
	    "vvc_instance_id": 0,
	    "vvc_cfg": {"cosim_support": 1}
	  },
	  {
	    "vvc_type": "UART_VVC",
	    "vvc_channel": "TX",
	    "vvc_instance_id": 0,
	    "vvc_cfg": {"cosim_support": 1}
	  },
	  {
	    "vvc_type": "AXISTREAM_VVC",
	    "vvc_channel": "NA",
	    "vvc_instance_id": 0,
	    "vvc_cfg": {"cosim_support": 1, "packet_based": 0}
	  },
	  {
	    "vvc_type": "AXISTREAM_VVC",
	    "vvc_channel": "NA",
	    "vvc_instance_id": 1,
	    "vvc_cfg": {"cosim_support": 1, "packet_based": 0}
	  }
    ]
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

All detected VVCs are included in this list, but not all VVCs are supported by the co-sim library. For example the clock generator VVC reported above, where the `cosim_support` field is zero. The `config` field may also contain VVC specific values, such as the `packet_based` field shown for the AXISTREAM VVCs above.

TODO: Maybe report only the VVCs that can are supported by cosim? Seems unnecessary to report the others and they I don't need a `cosim_support` field.

## Transmit and receive bytes

`TransmitBytes(VVC_TYPE, VVC_ID, [bytes])`
`ReceiveBytes(VVC_TYPE, VVC_ID, num_bytes, all_or_nothing)`

Supported VVCs:

- UART VVC
- AXISTREAM VVC with check\_packet\_length disabled in config
- AVALON-ST (planned) with use\_packet\_transfer disabled in config

## Transmit and receive packet

Planned, but **NOT** implemented yet:

`TransmitPacket(VVC_TYPE, VVC_ID, [packet])`
`ReceiveBytes(VVC_TYPE, VVC_ID)`

## Note on VVC configurations and channels

Some BFM configuration values are reported with the `GetVvcList` method, such as packet based which is possible for AXI-Stream and Avalon-ST. Unfortunately, not all 

It is not necessary to specify VVC channel for any of the `transmit_bytes`, `transmit_packet`, `receive_bytes`, or `receive_packet` methods.
